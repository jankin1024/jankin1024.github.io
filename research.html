<h2>eFMT-SLAM</h2>
<p>Unlike the VO algorithm based on feature points, eFMT VO analyzes the representation of the image in the frequency
domain to extract the camera's motion transformation. And it is applied to consecutive images and the camera pose is
then estimated via the chain rule of the transforms. This project mainly focuses on the SLAM algorithm that is extended by eFMT-based visual odometry(VO). It detects
and closes loops in the path of the camera, and applies eFMT to two non-consecutive but overlapping frames to
furtherly constraining the pose of the camera.</p>
<h2>Accurate calibration of multi-perspective cameras from a generalization of the hand-eye constraint</h2>
<p>Large system size or absence of overlap in neighbouring fields-of-view often complicate their calibration.</p>
<p>This project presents a novel solution that relies on the availability of an external motion capture system. Our core
contribution consists of an extension to the hand-eye calibration problem which jointly solves multi-eye-to-base
problems in closed form. We furthermore demonstrate its equivalence to the multi-eye-in-hand problem. The practical validity of our approach
is supported by our experiments, indicating that the method is highly efficient and accurate, and outperforms existing
closed-form alternatives.</p>
<h2>Mapping robot</h2>
<p>This project aims to build a robot. It should feature many more sensors (e.g. 11 cameras: additionally stereo back and monocular down, all at 60 frames per second; three event cameras; stereo infrared cameras; an omni-directional camera; 5 RGBD cameras; 4 high-resolution 3D LiDARs, as well as sonar &amp; radar sensors). With this sensors, we can collect more accurate and perfect environment data.</p>
<h2>Laser-omni-sinusoid</h2>
<p>After radar scans to obtain environmental information, the point cloud is projected onto a plane to form a picture. Use Fourier transform to analyze the transformation of pictures corresponding to consecutive frames, thereby inferring the camera's pose changes</p>
<h2>Undergraduate Thesis: Design of autonomous navigation mobile robot based on ROS</h2>
<p>Validated SLAM algorithms such as gmapping, hector-slam and cartographer in gazebo and Rviz simulation environments, and was familiar with the complete autonomous navigation simulation experiment process. </p>

<li><p>This project presented a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm-based multi-robot olfaction method (UPSO) for locating time-varying contaminant sources in the indoor steady flow field with mechanical ventilation. For locating time-varying indoor particle sources under other ventilation modes, this study proposes the UWOA method based on Whale Optimization Algorithm. </p>
