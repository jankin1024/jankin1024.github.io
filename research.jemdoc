This image contains five single images. The first two are input images im0, im1. The third one is rotated im0 and the fourth is registered im0.
We can find that these two images are registed very well from the last image.

With the increasing application of intelligent mobile robots, stable and efficient Visual Odometry (VO) algorithms are becoming more and more important. Extended Fourier-Mellin Transform (eFMT) is a Fourier-Mellin Transform (FMT)-based image registration method that can be applied to top-down cameras, such as on aerial and underwater vehicles. eFMT extends FMT to multi-depth scenes, thus extending to more application scenarios. On this basis, we developed an optimized eFMT algorithm o-eFMT. We design and implement a pose estimation algorithm from several aspects. This algorithm first uses the Fourier Mellin Transform to convert the image to the frequency domain for processing, then extracts the scaling, rotation and translation transformations between images in two steps, and finally expresses the rotation and translation transformations in multi-depth scenes in the form of energy vectors. Through pattern matching, the scale of continuous pose estimation is unified. Furthermore, combination of the estimated pose with back-end optimization is used to optimize the loop closure of three consecutive frames, which improves the accuracy of the pose estimation.

The advantages of the algorithm in this thesis are: (1) use a new method to extract energy vectors, (2) improve the accuracy of pattern matching, (3) introduce a back-end optimization module, and thus reduce the error of camera pose estimation.

Unlike the VO algorithm based on feature points, eFMT VO analyzes the representation of the image in the frequency 
domain to extract the camera's motion transformation. And it is applied to consecutive images and the camera pose is 
then estimated via the chain rule of the transforms. This project mainly focuses on the SLAM algorithm that is extended 
by eFMT-based visual odometry(VO). It detects and closes loops in the path of the camera, and applies eFMT to two 
non-consecutive but overlapping frames to furtherly constraining the pose of the camera.

== 2022\/06 - 2022\/07, Multi-cameras and IMU synchronization
In order to verify a developing SLAM method, we need to collect datasets with ground truth. We install 5 monocular cameras, 1 IMU and 1 GNNS receiver on the top of a car. The frequency of image messages is 40 Hz and IMU messages' frequency is 400 Hz. But the GPS frame's frequency is only 10 Hz. These sensors have a pin for registering. Considering the IMU frequency is so high and it can publish a sample signal with low frequency, a proper way is to let IMU be the time source and trigger cameras and GNNS receiver. 
All sensors and launched with ros drivers and communicate with rostopic. Three computers connect all sensors and store the data by advertising topics.

This project presents a novel solution that relies on the availability of an external motion capture system. Our core
contribution consists of an extension to the hand-eye calibration problem which jointly solves multi-eye-to-base
problems in closed form. We furthermore demonstrate its equivalence to the multi-eye-in-hand problem. The practical validity of our approach
is supported by our experiments, indicating that the method is highly efficient and accurate, and outperforms existing
closed-form alternatives.
